## Future Use

This script is ready to be used in future elections. This will require the user to supply data in a .csv format with same structure as election_results.csv. The script will need to be modified in lines 6 and 9 to match directory where results file is stored. Additional results may be reported with some modifications, e.g. the winner in each county may or runner-up may also be reported.
